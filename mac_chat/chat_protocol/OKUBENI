1) modify smac with your own mac address, (learn from cat /sys/class/net/mon0/address)

for mac addr 60:36:DD:50:A0:DC
modify your code as following

static const char *smac = "\x60\x36\xdd\x50\xa0\xdc";

2) for announcement, only send your nickname as payload

3) get announcement packets and learn other's NAME & MAC ADDR INFO 

4) send data to others (but your friends MAC addr to dmac)

5) to receive data fromo others, filter your own smac as dmac
